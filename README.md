Hi There ðŸ‘‹

Iâ€™m Fenny, an experienced Community of Happiness, Event, and Program Coordinator with a demonstrated history of working in the tourism & hospitality industry. Working with start ups allowed me to get surface-level experience in most digital marketing channels, and has helped me find my interest in data analysis, Content creation, and web design.
